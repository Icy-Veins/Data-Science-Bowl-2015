\section{Current Status}
Our team has made some progress in acquiring the necessary data. Since the project is centered around a Kaggle competition, the data is readily available to registered teams. We have submitted our team to Kaggle and downloaded a compressed format of the data.

In its compressed form, the data is 2GB, but when uncompressed, it is 40GB. As a result, we expect to utilize one of the many servers on campus to store and analyze the data. Darryl Mouck, the CSSE system administrator is building a new 64 core machine, so we are going to ask him if we can use that.
